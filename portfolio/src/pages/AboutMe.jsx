      <p>Hi there!</p>
      <p>My name is Grace Kirk and I am a new web developer. Before I became a web developer, I have had experience in Marketing, Creative Services, and editing photos, videos, and written media with the Adobe Suite. Within web development I have experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Web API's, Node, Typescript, Servers, React, Vite, SQL, MongoDB, Mongoose, and MERN. My favorite things to work on as a web developer are projects with databases and projects where I can play freely with the CSS. I'll update this site when I can, but you can always look at my Github to see what I'm up to!</p>
